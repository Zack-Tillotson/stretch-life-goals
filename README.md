# Stretch: Life Goals
Zack Tillotson

## Development

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8888/
```

## Description

Track life goals and push yourself to do your best! Base goals are set for a given timeframe (boring!), but then you also set stretch goals for youself which encourages you to keep going even after you meet your initial goal (yay!).
